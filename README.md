A simple, responsive showcase of my early frontend projects using HTML5 and CSS3. Designed with accessibility and semantic structure in mind, this layout serves as my live gallery and entry point to each individual project.

## üîç Overview

This website is a personal portfolio hub that displays multiple beginner-level HTML5 and CSS3 projects. Each project is represented by a preview image and hover-reveal title. The layout is responsive, uses semantic HTML, and follows mobile-first design principles.

I built this during my learning path following the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **Responsive Web Design Certification** course and extended it with my own custom styling, accessibility features, and layout system.

## ‚ú® Features

- Responsive grid layout for all screen sizes
- Semantic HTML structure with proper use of headings, `section`, and `footer`
- Custom CSS variables for theming and easy maintenance
- Animated hover effects for project cards
- Focus-visible states for keyboard accessibility
- Media queries to adapt grid layout (1, 2, 3 columns)
