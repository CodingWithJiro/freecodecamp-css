## üîç Overview

This website is a personal portfolio hub that displays multiple beginner-level HTML5 and CSS3 projects. Each project is represented by a preview image and hover-reveal title. The layout is responsive, uses semantic HTML, and follows mobile-first design principles.

I built this during my learning path following the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **Responsive Web Design Certification** course and extended it with my own custom styling, accessibility features, and layout system.

- Custom CSS variables for theming and easy maintenance
